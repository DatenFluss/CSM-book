    "Hashing is a technique used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. It involves using a hash function to convert a given key into another value, which is typically an index used to store and retrieve data efficiently.",
    "A hash function is a function that takes an input (or 'key') and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. The output, typically a 'hash code', is usually a 'digest' that is unique to each unique input.",
    "Hash tables use hash functions to map keys to indices in an array. This allows for fast data retrieval because, ideally, each key maps to a unique index. However, collisions can occur when two keys hash to the same index. Various strategies, such as chaining and open addressing, are used to handle collisions."
